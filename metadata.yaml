description: To Corydon, on the other hand, a name was a vital thing; a child that
  was lovely under one name might be unendurable under another. She had been reading
  Ossian, and the poems of the neo-Celtic enthusiasts; so after much pondering and
  consultation she announced that Cedric and Eileen were the two names from which
  they would choose.
